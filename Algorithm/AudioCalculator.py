# #assuming 8kHz (16000 data points for 2s, 32000 for 4s) for data collection this is how we slice an array into parts
# i = 0
# for i =< data_array.shape//16000:
#     c = slice(i, i+32000, 1) #the number 1 can be changed to 2 (or larger) which skips over every other data point (this can be used to speed up the algorithm)
#     data_slice = data_array[0][c]
#     #do things with slice
#     #append info to data_array (in the correct area)
#     i += 16000
# return data_array
